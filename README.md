# Large Seeds, Bats, and Tents: A Neotropical Dispersal Story

ABSTRACT

The story of seed dispersal by frugivorous bats (Family: Phyllostomidae) in the Neotropics has been extensively documented over the years, with most studies focusing on small seeds that can be ingested and dispersed during flight. However, an ecologically significant group of plants bearing large-seeded fruits is also dispersed by tent-roosting bats. For this group of Neotropical bats, roosting sites - commonly referred to as - “tents”, perform a crucial role in the dissemination process of large seeds. Through our systematic analysis, we highlight the understudied role of tent-roosting bats as dispersers of large seeds via stomatochory. Specifically, we present insights on 1) the geographic and temporal distribution of studies addressing large-seeded dispersal by tent-roosting bats, 2) taxonomic distribution of both plants and bat species involved in this interaction, 3) stomatochorous plant-bat interaction network, 4) morphological traits of fruit and seeds dispersed by this group, and explore 5) the relationship between bat body size and the size of fruits they transport, finally 6) provide a perspective and synthesis on the ecological and provisioning-services relevance of tent-roosting bats in the Neotropics.
